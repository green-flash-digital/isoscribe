  <p>An isomorphic logging utility for any JavaScript runtime, providing structured, styled, and extensible logs for platform and browser contexts.</p>

## Overview

**Isoscribe** is an isomorphic logging utility that allows you to easily log structured and non structured content across your full stack application. For the most part, logging utilities are single purpose and cannot be used across your stack. That is, you can log our backend procedures, services, controllers, utils, etc.. however when it comes to the front-end logging is relegated to `console.log|warn|error`.

**Isoscribe** attempts to solve that problem by offering the same logging mechanisms traditionally geared toward platform development. During runtime, the tool evaluates the context in which it's running and logs out structured messages to provide insight into the execution of your code.
